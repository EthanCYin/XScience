Welcome 👋

------

Today is a special day! On August 1, 2025, my very first personal academic homepage, XScience, is finally live!

"XScience" is short for "Extreme Science," representing my research interest in extreme scientific topics like wildfires, heatwaves, and compound events. Going forward, I'll be sharing my latest research progress and stories from my travels here.

To my pleasant surprise, today also marks the start of my second year as a postdoctoral fellow. Starting a new chapter on such a memorable day feels fantastic!

A Tip for Setup:
The site was built using the [Academic CV template](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/academic-cv/) by Hugo Blox. It's powerful, beautifully designed, and very easy to get started with. Highly recommended!

Finally, I'd like to share a little trick I encountered that wasn't clearly mentioned in the official documentation:
To use a custom icon, you need to upload your .svg file (e.g., running.svg) to the following path:
assets/media/icons/custom/running.svg

Then, call it in your configuration file like this:
icon: custom/running

I hope this little tip helps someone out there.

今天是个特别的日子！2025年8月的第一天，我的第一个个人学术主页 XScience 终于上线了！

“XScience”是“Extreme Science”的缩写，代表了我对野火、热浪、复合事件等极端科学问题的研究兴趣。今后，我会在这里分享我的最新研究进展和旅途中的所见所闻。

更让我惊喜的是，今天恰好也是我开启博士后第二年生涯的第一天。在这样一个充满纪念意义的日子里开启新的篇章，感觉棒极了！

建站经验分享：
主页是使用 Hugo Blox 的 [Academic CV 模板](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/academic-cv/)搭建的，它功能强大、设计美观，而且非常容易上手，强烈推荐！

最后，分享一个我遇到的、官方文档中未明确提及的小技巧：
如果需要使用自定义图标（custom icon），你需要将 .svg 文件（例如 running.svg）上传到以下路径：
assets/media/icons/custom/running.svg

然后在配置中这样调用它：
icon: custom/running

希望这个小提示能帮到有需要的人。
