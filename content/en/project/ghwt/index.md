A long-term global heat wave record dataset was constructed using three historical hourly climate data of CRU-JRA, ERA5 and GLDAS and future daily climate data of GFDL-ESM4 under three SSPS (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). These datasets are based on constant thresholds over 35 Â°C, percentile thresholds over 90%, and duration thresholds over 3 days. The Python file is the source code for the Global Heat Wave Toolbox, which can be used to generate heat wave records based on custom thresholds.
