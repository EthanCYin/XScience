abstract: 'Compound events (CEs) are attracting increased attention due to their significant
  societal and ecological impacts. However, their inherent complexity can pose challenges
  for climate scientists and practitioners, highlighting the need for a more approachable
  and intuitive framework for detecting and visualising CEs. Here, we introduce the
  Compound Events Toolbox and Dataset (CETD), which provides the first integrated,
  interactive, and extensible platform for CE detection and visualisation. Employing
  observations, reanalysis, and model simulations, CETD can quantify the frequency,
  duration, and severity of multiple CE types: multivariate, sequential, and concurrent
  events. It can analyse CEs often linked to severe impacts on human health, wildfires,
  and air pollution, such as hot-dry, wet-windy, and hot-dry-stagnation events. To
  validate the performance of CETD, we conduct statistical analyses for several high-impact
  events, such as the 2019 Australian wildfires and the 2022 European heatwaves. The
  accessibility and extensibility of CETD will benefit the broader community by enabling
  them to better understand and prepare for the risks and challenges posed by CEs
  in a warming world.'
