abstract: 'The important effect of climate factors on spring phenology has been confirmed
  by numerous studies, but its temporal variation remains unclear. Based on the daily
  meteorological observation data and annual vegetation phenology data from 1987 to
  2016, this study proposes a Time Window Sliding Fitting (TWSF) method. Partial Least
  Squares (PLS) regression is used to investigate the relationship between spring
  phenology and five climate factors, including mean temperature, total precipitation,
  mean photoperiod, chilling index and forcing index, in all time windows from December
  to next May with 7-day interval in Qinling Mountains (QLMs) of China. The results
  show that: (1) Temperature in QLMs has an increasing trend with 0.41 °C/10a, and
  precipitation decreases with 400 mm/a. Moreover, spring phenology in QLMs is advancing
  with 4 days/10a. (2) Temperature is found having dominant effect on spring phenology
  in QLMs, and photoperiod has a significant effect on spring phenology in grassland
  area. (3) Temperature’s impact increases in cultivated land and grassland after
  March 25 but a consecutive decrease trend in forest, while photoperiod’s explanatory
  ability on grassland spring phenology is highlighted in early January, early February
  and early April. Chilling has the best explanatory ability on crop spring phenology
  in early March and early May. Additionally, forcing can significantly influence
  spring phenology in early March for cultivated land and late May for forest. The
  results of this study are beneficial to understand the mechanism of plant-climate
  interaction.'
