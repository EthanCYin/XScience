Welcome!

------

Today is a special day! On August 1, 2025, my very first personal academic homepage, XScience, is finally live!

"XScience" is short for "Extreme Science," representing my research interest in extreme scientific topics like wildfires, heatwaves, and compound events. Going forward, I'll be sharing my latest research progress and stories from my travels here.

To my pleasant surprise, today also marks the start of my second year as a postdoctoral fellow. Starting a new chapter on such a memorable day feels fantastic!

A Tip for Setup:
The site was built using the [Academic CV template](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/academic-cv/) by Hugo Blox. It's powerful, beautifully designed, and very easy to get started with. Highly recommended!

Finally, I'd like to share a little trick I encountered that wasn't clearly mentioned in the official documentation:
To use a custom icon, you need to upload your .svg file (e.g., running.svg) to the following path:
assets/media/icons/custom/running.svg

Then, call it in your configuration file like this:
icon: custom/running

I hope this little tip helps someone out there.
