Welcome 👋

------

On February 22, 2025, I launched a WeChat public account called Extreme Science, focusing on extreme hydroclimatic events such as wildfires and heatwaves. The goal is to share original research, cutting-edge developments in the field, and practical resources.

The primary motivation behind creating this platform was to document my research progress and keep a record of technical challenges and solutions I encounter in daily work. I’ve found it to be a helpful way to revisit knowledge, skills, and ideas.

As of today (August 3, 2025), the account has attracted 944 followers and accumulated over 10,000 total reads—an encouraging milestone that motivates me to keep going.

2025年2月22日，我创建了一个微信公众号“极端科学”，聚焦野火和热浪等极端水文气候事件，致力于分享原创研究、领域前沿与实用资源。

创建这个公众号的主要目的是分享研究进展，并记录平时工作中遇到的技术问题和解决方案。我发现这很有助于去回顾知识、技能和想法。

到今天（2025年8月3日），公众号获得了944个用户的关注，总阅读量超过10000次，这激励我继续坚持下去。
