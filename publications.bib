	abstract = {Heat waves are continuous high temperature processes, which are defined as the daily maximum temperature exceeding the absolute-relative combined high temperature thresholds for more than three consecutive days in this study. Because of its unprecedented casualties, devastating compound disasters and irreversible deterioration trends, heat waves have attracted worldwide concern, while its global changes and socioeconomic impacts still need further study. Using three historical reanalysis data and multi scenario CMIP6 modeled data, Global Heat Wave Toolbox (GHWT) was developed to generate heat wave matrix from 1971 to 2100. The long-term changing characteristics of global heat waves were also analyzed. Next, population and GDP projections are employed to estimate future socioeconomic exposure and risks. The results show that except for high latitudes (latitude greater than 60°), high elevations and some coastal areas, heat waves have visited about 45\% (±3\%) of the global land area (excluding Antarctica). North Africa, North Australia, South Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula are detected as high heat wave area, where experience more than three heat waves with total duration over 15 days annually. Additionally, the average growth rate of global heat waves under SSP2 4.5 and SSP5 8.5 may be 2–3 times and 3–5 times of that under SSP1 2.6, respectively. Under SSP2 4.5, there may be about 7.32 billion people exposed to heat waves in 2100, accounting for 82.65\% of the global population. Economic exposure may reach \$433.37 trillion in 2100, accounting for 82.23\% of the total global economy in that year. India could have the highest population and economic exposure, follow by populous countries, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, and major economies, such as China and the United States. Under SSP1 2.6, the increase in heat waves may slow down significantly. Moreover, North Africa, Australia, and Brazil are identified as rapid heat wave growth area. Our study highlights the heat wave of future growth and its socioeconomic impacts, as well as the necessity for climate mitigation and adaptation measures.},

	abstract = {Compound events (CEs) are attracting increased attention due to their significant societal and ecological impacts. However, their inherent complexity can pose challenges for climate scientists and practitioners, highlighting the need for a more approachable and intuitive framework for detecting and visualising CEs. Here, we introduce the Compound Events Toolbox and Dataset (CETD), which provides the first integrated, interactive, and extensible platform for CE detection and visualisation. Employing observations, reanalysis, and model simulations, CETD can quantify the frequency, duration, and severity of multiple CE types: multivariate, sequential, and concurrent events. It can analyse CEs often linked to severe impacts on human health, wildfires, and air pollution, such as hot-dry, wet-windy, and hot-dry-stagnation events. To validate the performance of CETD, we conduct statistical analyses for several high-impact events, such as the 2019 Australian wildfires and the 2022 European heatwaves. The accessibility and extensibility of CETD will benefit the broader community by enabling them to better understand and prepare for the risks and challenges posed by CEs in a warming world.},

Based on the daily meteorological observation data and annual vegetation phenology data from 1987 to 2016, this study proposes a Time Window Sliding Fitting (TWSF) method. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is used to investigate the relationship between spring phenology and five climate factors, including mean temperature, total precipitation, mean photoperiod, chilling index and forcing index, in all time windows from December to next May with 7-day interval in Qinling Mountains (QLMs) of China. The results show that: (1) Temperature in QLMs has an increasing trend with 0.41 °C/10a, and precipitation decreases with 400 mm/a. Moreover, spring phenology in QLMs is advancing with 4 days/10a. (2) Temperature is found having dominant effect on spring phenology in QLMs, and photoperiod has a significant effect on spring phenology in grassland area. (3) Temperature’s impact increases in cultivated land and grassland after March 25 but a consecutive decrease trend in forest, while photoperiod’s explanatory ability on grassland spring phenology is highlighted in early January, early February and early April. Chilling has the best explanatory ability on crop spring phenology in early March and early May. Additionally, forcing can significantly influence spring phenology in early March for cultivated land and late May for forest. The results of this study are beneficial to understand the mechanism of plant-climate interaction.},

Therefore, it is necessary to describe the trends of future climate change with more concise conclusions. Climatic analogs are an effective method used to measure the similarity between two climate scenarios. By mapping a given climate scenario to another, familiar climate scenario and measuring their similarity, complex climate prediction models can be simplified and made easier to understand. In this study, we used climatic analogs of 378 cities in China and the suitable future climate area of China to study climatic novelty in China. The results show that (1) climatic novelty in the North China Plain, Xinjiang, Tibet, and parts of southern China is relatively high, and these areas may experience more drastic climate changes than other areas; (2) most cities have climatic analogs to the south, hundreds of kilometers away, indicating that the climates of these cities may change significantly; and (3) China’s suitable climate area will change significantly in the future, and these changes are closely related to whether effective emission reduction measures are taken. The results of this study have repeatedly proven the need for effective emission reduction measures that will significantly delay climate change.},

	abstract = {Snow-induced radiative forcing (SnRF), defined as the instantaneous perturbation of the Earth’s shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), results from variations in the terrestrial snow cover extent (SCE), and is critical for the regulation of the Earth’s energy budget. However, with the growing seasonal divergence of SCE over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in the past two decades, novel insights pertaining to SnRF are lacking. Consequently, the contribution of SnRF to TOA shortwave radiation anomalies still remains unclear. Utilizing the latest datasets of snow cover, surface albedo, and albedo radiative kernels, this study investigated the distribution of SnRF over the NH and explored its changes from 2000 to 2019. The 20-year averaged annual mean SnRF in the NH was −1.13 ± 0.05 W m−2, with a weakening trend of 0.0047 Wm−2 yr−1 (p {\textless} 0.01) during 2000–2019, indicating that an extra 0.094 W m−2 of shortwave radiation was absorbed by the Earth climate system. Moreover, changes in SnRF were highly correlated with satellite-observed TOA shortwave flux anomalies (r = 0.79, p {\textless} 0.05) during 2000–2019. Additionally, a detailed contribution analysis revealed that the SnRF in snow accumulation months, from March to May, accounted for 58.10\% of the annual mean SnRF variability across the NH. These results can assist in providing a better understanding of the role of snow cover in Earth’s climate system in the context of climate change. Although the rapid SCE decline over the NH has a hiatus for the period during 2000–2019, SnRF continues to follow a weakening trend. Therefore, this should be taken into consideration in current climate change models and future climate projections.},

	abstract = {Precipitation is an important component of the hydrological cycle and has significant impact on ecological environment and social development, especially in arid areas where water resources are scarce. As a typical arid and semi-arid region, the Mongolian Plateau is ecologically fragile and highly sensitive to climate change. Reliable global precipitation data is urgently needed for the sustainable development over this gauge-deficient region. With high-quality estimates, fine spatiotemporal resolutions, and wide coverage, the state-of-the-art Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) and European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) have great potential for regional climatic, hydrological, and ecological applications. However, how they perform has not been well investigated on the Mongolian Plateau. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of three IMERG V06 datasets (ER, LR and FR), two ERA5 products (ERA5-HRES and ERA5-Land), and their predecessors (TMPA-3B42 and ERA-Interim) over the region across 2001–2018. The results showed that all products broadly characterized seasonal precipitation cycles and spatial patterns, but only the three reanalysis products, IMERG FR and TMPA-3B42 could capture interannual and decadal variability. When describing daily precipitation, dataset performances ranked ERA5-Land {\textgreater} ERA5-HRES {\textgreater} ERA-Interim {\textgreater} IMERG FR {\textgreater} IMERG LR {\textgreater} IMERG ER {\textgreater} TMPA-3B42. All products showed deficiencies in overestimating weak precipitation and underestimating high-intensity precipitation. Besides, products performed best in agricultural lands and forests along the northern and south-eastern edges, followed by urban areas and grasslands closer to the center, and worst in the sparse vegetation and bare areas of the south-west. Due to a negative effect of topographic complexity, IMERG showed poor detection capabilities in forests. Accordingly, this research currently supports the applicability of reanalysis ERA5 data over the arid, topographically complex Mongolian Plateau, which can inform regional applications with different requirements.},

Apparent temperature accounting for other meteorological variables, such as humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, is the equivalent temperature, and it is a more accurate indicator to reflect human's environmental temperature perception. High-quality apparent temperature data are urgently needed for the further research on human–environment interactions. At the same time, as global heat waves continue to increase in frequency, duration and intensity, understanding the impact of heat waves on human health needs human perception-based heat wave data. Using ERA5 hourly data on single levels of 2 m temperature, wind speed, dewpoint temperature and solar radiation, this study developed a global apparent temperature and heat wave (GATHW) toolbox based on the Climate Data Store (CDS) online platform. This toolbox allows using three methods to calculate daily apparent temperature and heat wave at three spatial resolutions of 0.25°, 0.5° and 1° respectively. It can realize online calculation, display and real-time download and is updated in near real-time. The global daily apparent temperature and annual heat wave dataset from 2006 to 2020 calculated by the toolbox can be obtained from https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4764325. After evaluation, this dataset can well reflect the typical extreme temperatures and heat wave events, and is more accurate, with higher resolution and faster update frequency than similar data products, which can provide data support for the study of human–environmental interactions and extreme climate events.},

              The fragile ecological environment of the Mongolian Plateau (MP) is sensitive to climate change. It is necessary to fully understand the temperature and precipitation changes on the MP to ensure regional sustainable development. Most existing studies are conducted based on station observations which suffer from sparse distribution and limited spatial representativeness and cannot perfectly represent the climatic conditions of the whole region. By contrast, the long‐term, spatially continuous reanalysis products offer new opportunities for MP climate change research. However, the coarse spatial resolution and large uncertainties of reanalysis data limit their applicability to provide reliable climate information at finer scales. Within the delta downscaling framework, we downscale and correct the state‐of‐the‐art European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis 5 land portion (ERA5‐Land) using a high‐resolution WorldClim reference climatology and generate a long‐term (1950–2020) 1‐km monthly air temperature and precipitation downscaled dataset. During the downscaling process, the results obtained by nearest neighbour, bilinear and bicubic interpolation methods are evaluated and compared. Air temperature result of bilinear method and precipitation result of nearest neighbour method, which have the best accuracy, are taken as the final downscaled data. The evaluation shows that the downscaled data has acceptable accuracy (overall MBE = −0.41°C, Corr = 0.997, RMSE = 1.51°C for air temperature, and MBE = 1.58 mm·month
              −1

              −1
              for precipitation), and outperforms the original ERA5‐Land and widely used Climatic Research Unit (CRU) data. In addition, the downscaled data can also provide accurate and detailed temperature and precipitation change trends over the MP. With fine spatial resolution, long‐time span and good spatial continuity, the downscaled air temperature and precipitation will be a useful data source to explore climate change over the MP.},

	abstract = {The Transformer model, as an emerging deep learning method, shows great potential in spatiotemporal sequence-related simulation tasks. However, there is very limited understanding of its performance in soil moisture (SM) simulation. Here, we present a Transformer-based SM simulation network (SMSNet) to improve the quality of the widely used Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM product by reconstructing and downscaling the pixels, and obtain daily SM products with resolutions of 9 km and 1 km. The model employs spatiotemporal attention in separate Transformer structures to extract patterns of 10 dynamic (MODIS Bands 1–7, land cover, land surface temperature, and precipitation) and 8 static variables (soil bulk density, clay content, gravel content, sand content, silt content, digital elevation model, latitude, and longitude) to establish the relationship between variable pattern and SMAP SM distribution. The SM product reconstructed by SMSNet shows good agreement with in-situ measurements (SCAN network: R = 0.639, RMSE = 0.086 m3/m3. UCSRN network: R = 0.665, RMSE = 0.097 m3/m3) at the Continental United States. Moreover, it can effectively mitigate the overestimation degree of SMAP SM and improve the accuracy in forest. The seamless mapping of SMAP SM is achieved using reconstructed SM to fill the gap, and the gap-filling SM exhibits reasonable spatiotemporal pattern. The downscaled 1 km SM performs similar accuracy degrees to those of the reconstructed ones, proving the applicability of transferring 9 km scale established SMSNet to 1 km scale SM simulation. The downscaled dataset can provide detailed SM characteristics, which further enhances the merit of SMAP SM at regional analysis. Moreover, both reconstructed and downscaled SMs exhibit accuracy superiority compared to the corresponding results from Cubic Spline Interpolation, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network. Overall, our study highlights the benefits and potential of SMSNet in generating SM products with favorable accuracy over diverse and vast regions.},
